# hello-world
initial repository - getting started
working python in "the Self-Taught Programmer"
last open issue is creating a web scraper
which requires BeautifulSoup 
I have Python 3 installed, and the download of BS that I have is for python 2
2to3 is a conversion tool, but it's on GitHub
I have been here before - I think the original python that I started for Raspberry Pi-3 project
